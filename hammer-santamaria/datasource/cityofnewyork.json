The figures in the table have been adjusted to reflect debt service that was originally scheduled for payment in each year since 2000.\n2By law, New York City is required to have a balanced annual budget. In years when it runs a surplus, the primary means the city uses to comply with this requirement is to use up some or all of the surplus by prepaying some of the subsequent years’ debt service expenses.

OPT staff use a variety of systems to generate and share bus route information with bus vendors and the public. Specific bus route paths cannot be publicly disclosed because they could reveal personally identifiable information about individual students. In this dataset, OPT has provided all the route information that does not risk disclosing personally identifiable information. \r\nSchool-age service for students in grades K through 12 are contracted with bus vendors on a per route basis. OPT also manages bus service for Pre-K students who require curb-to-curb service as per a student’s Individualized Education Plan (IEP). This Pre-K bus service is contracted on a per student basis, instead of per route. As a consequence of this difference, OPT does not design bus routes for Pre-K service, so those routes are not included in this dataset.\r\nThere are a variety of different vehicles used on routes that serve students requiring curb-to-curb service because an Individualized Education Plan (IEP) indicates specific transportation needs. The standard bus is the only vehicle used for general education routes with students eligible for bus service but who do not have an IEP.\r\nUsers may occasionally see a route without a garage assignment. Because this dataset is derived from a snapshot of a transactional system, there may be routes that are in the process of being assigned to a garage. In those cases, the garage information will appear as NULL until the assignment is complete.","author":"Department of Education (DOE)","link":"https://data.cityofnewyork.us/d/8yac-vygm","api-link":"https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/8yac-vygm.json","dataset-type":"JSON","url":"https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/8yac-vygm.json","meta":["garage_state","vendor_code","vendor_affiliation","garage_city","garage_street_name","route_number","ycoordinates","vendor_name","school_year","service_type","garage_zip","vehicle_typedescription","xcoordinates","route_start_date"],"other_tags":["Department of Education (DOE)","one","opts","main","functions","plan","efficient","and","fiscally","responsible","school","bus","routes","opt","staff","use","variety","systems","generate","and","share","bus","route","information","with","bus","vendors","and","the","public","specific","bus","route","paths","cannot","publicly","disclosed","because","they","could","reveal","personally","identifiable","information","about","individual","students","this","dataset","opt","has","provided","all","the","route","information","that","does","not","risk","disclosing","personally","identifiable","information","school","age","service","for","students","grades","through","are","contracted","with","bus","vendors","per","route","basis","opt","also","manages","bus","service","for","pre","students","who","require","curb","curb","service","per","students","individualized","education","plan","iep","this","pre","bus","service","contracted","per","student","basis","instead","per","route","consequence","this","difference","opt","does","not","design","bus","routes","for","pre","service","those","routes","are","not","included","this","dataset","there","are","variety","different","vehicles","used","routes","that","serve","students","requiring","curb","curb","service","because","individualized","education","plan","iep","indicates","specific","transportation","needs","the","standard","bus","the","only","vehicle","used","for","general","education","routes","with","students","eligible","for","bus","service","but","who","not","have","iep","users","may","occasionally","see","route","without","garage","assignment","because","this","dataset","derived","from","snapshot","transactional","system","there","may","routes","that","are","the","process","being","assigned","garage","those","cases","the","garage","information","will","appear","null","until","the","assignment","complete"],"last-find":{"$date":"2017-07-11T08:10:51.556Z"}},

This is the 3ft version of the high-resolution land cover dataset for New York City. Seven land cover classes were mapped: (1) tree canopy, (2) grass/shrub, (3) bare earth, (4) water, (5) buildings, (6) roads, and (7) other paved surfaces.  The minimum mapping unit for the delineation of features was set at 3 square feet. The primary sources used to derive this land cover layer were the 2010 LiDAR and the 2008 4-band orthoimagery.  Ancillary data sources included GIS data (city boundary, building footprints, water, parking lots, roads, railroads, railroad structures, ballfields) provided by New York City (all ancillary datasets except railroads); UVM Spatial Analysis Laboratory manually created railroad polygons from manual interpretation of 2008 4-band orthoimagery.  The tree canopy class was considered current as of 2010; the remaining land-cover classes were considered current as of 2008. Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) techniques were employed to extract land cover information using the best available remotely sensed and vector GIS datasets.  OBIA systems work by grouping pixels into meaningful objects based on their spectral and spatial properties, while taking into account boundaries imposed by existing vector datasets.  Within the OBIA environment a rule-based expert system was designed to effectively mimic the process of manual image analysis by incorporating the elements of image interpretation (color/tone, texture, pattern, location, size, and shape) into the classification process.  A series of morphological procedures were employed to insure that the end product is both accurate and cartographically pleasing. More than 35,000 corrections were made to the classification.  Overall accuracy was 96%. This dataset was developed as part of the Urban Tree Canopy (UTC) Assessment for New York City.  As such, it represents a 'top down' mapping perspective in which tree canopy over hanging other features is assigned to the tree canopy class.

The dataset contains records for each individual, scenic, or interior landmark, as well as properties or sites located within the boundaries of historic districts. Please note that points in this dataset represent individual buildings in addition to non-building sites (such as vacant lots or monuments) regulated by LPC. It is possible for a single property to have multiple designations (such as individual and interior designations, or individual and historic district). For this reason, it is not uncommon to see multiple points on a single tax lot and multiple records for a single property within the database. Please pay close attention to the \"MOST_CURRENT,\" \"BBL_STATUS and \"LAST_ACTION_ON_LP\" fields, which together denote the designation status of a site/property (see Attribute Definitions for more information). The geographic locations of the points in this dataset are derived primarily from the Department of City Planning's PLUTO data in combination with the Department of Information Technology \u0026 Telecommunication's building footprint information. Because this dataset is not automatically updated when changes occur in the underlying dataset, BIN numbers and tax lot information are potentially out of date.

Higher values indicate student populations with higher need\r\n\r\n2) Middle \u0026 High - peer index is a value from 1.00-4.50.  For middle schools, we use the average 4th grade proficiency ratings in ELA and Math for all their students that have 4th grade test scores.  For high schools, we use the average 8th grade proficiency ratings in ELA and Math for all their students that have 8th grade test scores.

No peer index value is assigned because this set of schools is its own peer group. The reports contain 3 categories with one additional credit section.  Unlike the HS Progress Report, the Environment Category is only composed of Survey Results.  Performance measures 6-year graduation rate and Progress captures student level improvements in attendance, credit accumulation and Regents passed.

This dataset consists of TC metrics summarized to several different sets of geographic base layers. The metrics presented in this table are based on 2010 high resolution land cover dataset.\r\n\r\nThe TC Assessment is a top-down approach to analyzing the forest.  Its purpose is to integrate high resolution land cover data with other GIS datasets to produce a set of detailed metrics on the forest that allow decision makers to know how much tree canopy currently exists (termed Existing TC) and amount of land where is it biophysically feasible to establish tree canopy on (termed Possible TC). \r\n\r\nExisting TC is determined by extracting all features classified as tree canopy from a high resolution land cover dataset.  Possible TC is determined by identifying land where canopy could possibly exist.  Possible TC in a GIS context is determined by overlaying high resolution land cover with cadastral and planimetric datasets to include building polygons and road polygons.  \r\n\r\nPossible TC is queried out from this overlay and consists of all land that was not existing canopy, not water, not a building, and not a road.  Possible TC is further divided into two subcategories:  Possible-impervious and Possible-vegetation.  Possible-impervious consists of all impervious land that, through modification, could support tree canopy.  Examples of such features are parking lots, driveways (through overhanging coverage) and playgrounds.  Possible-vegetation consists of all land that is low-lying vegetation, primarily grass or shrubs, which could conceivably be converted to support tree canopy.  Examples of such features include residential lawns and playing fields.  TC metrics do not serve to address the issues of where it is socially desirable or financially feasible to plant trees.  Rather, the TC metrics serve as the basis for beginning to form answers to these questions.   \r\n\r\nTC metrics are presented in the attribute table as both absolute area (in map units) and relative area (...","author":"Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR)","link":"https://data.cityofnewyork.us/d/hnxz-kkn5","api-link":"https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/hnxz-kkn5.json","dataset-type":"JSON","url":"https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/hnxz-kkn5.json","meta":[],"other_tags":["Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR)","tree","canopy","tc","assessment","metrics","for","new","york","city","this","dataset","consists","metrics","summarized","several","different","sets","geographic","base","layers","the","metrics","presented","this","table","are","based","2010","high","resolution","land","cover","dataset","the","assessment","top","down","approach","analyzing","the","forest","its","purpose","integrate","high","resolution","land","cover","data","with","other","gis","datasets","produce","set","detailed","metrics","the","forest","that","allow","decision","makers","know","how","much","tree","canopy","currently","exists","termed","existing","tc","and","amount","land","where","biophysically","feasible","establish","tree","canopy","termed","possible","tc","existing","determined","extracting","all","features","classified","tree","canopy","from","high","resolution","land","cover","dataset","possible","determined","identifying","land","where","canopy","could","possibly","exist","possible","gis","context","determined","overlaying","high","resolution","land","cover","with","cadastral","and","planimetric","datasets","include","building","polygons","and","road","polygons","possible","queried","out","from","this","overlay","and","consists","all","land","that","was","not","existing","canopy","not","water","not","building","and","not","road","possible","further","divided","into","two","subcategories","possible","impervious","and","possible","vegetation","possible","impervious","consists","all","impervious","land","that","through","modification","could","support","tree","canopy","examples","such","features","are","parking","lots","driveways","through","overhanging","coverage","and","playgrounds","possible","vegetation","consists","all","land","that","low","lying","vegetation","primarily","grass","shrubs","which","could","conceivably","converted","support","tree","canopy","examples","such","features","include","residential","lawns","and","playing","fields","metrics","not","serve","address","the","issues","where","socially","desirable","financially","feasible","plant","trees","rather","the","metrics","serve","the","basis","for","beginning","form","answers","these","questions","tc","metrics","are","presented","the","attribute","table","both","absolute","area","in","map","units","and","relative","area"],"last-find":{"$date":"2017-07-11T08:10:51.881Z"}},

Results on earlier exams from 2006-2012 can be found at this link: http://schools.nyc.gov/NR/exeres/05289E74-2D81-4CC0-81F6-E1143E28F4C4,frameless.htm\n\nResults presented here include all students who sat for either the Math or ELA exam. On the NYSED website, results for \"matched\" students can be found. To account for participation changes across years and anticipate the importance of year-to-year same-cohort comparisons for the Class of 2022, \"matched\" Math and ELA results were calculated to include 4th grade students who were tested in both the current and previous year and to include 5th – 8th grade students who were tested in all three years.\nIn order to comply with FERPA regulations on public reporting of education outcomes, rows with 5 or fewer students are suppressed.\nFor 2013, District 75 students are represented in their home districts and boroughs. For 2014 \u0026 2015, they are not included.\nCharter schools are not included. School level charter data can be found here: http://schools.nyc.gov/Accountability/data/TestResults/ELAandMathTestResults\n\nIn 2007, the New York State Education Department updated its testing policy for English Language Learners: ELLs in an English Language School System for more than one year are required to take the ELA exam. Previously, ELLs in an English Language School System for less than 3 years were exempt from taking the ELA exam. \nA change in State testing policy drove a decrease in eighth grade proficiency rates in 2014: to reduce double testing, most students in accelerated math courses who took the Algebra Regents exam were exempted from taking the 7th or 8th grade State math assessment.\nFormer English Language Learners includes any students who were classified as English Language Learners in at least one of the previous two school years.","author":"Department of Education (DOE)","link":"https://data.cityofnewyork.us/d/jk35-yh5p","api-link":"https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/jk35-yh5p.json","dataset-type":"JSON","url":"https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/jk35-yh5p.json","meta":["level_4_2","level_1_1","year","level_1_2","level_2_1","level_2_2","level_3_1","level_3_2","level_4_1","school_name","level_3_4_2","number_tested","mean_scale_score","dbn","level_3_4_1","grade","category"],"other_tags":["Department of Education (DOE)","new","york","city","results","the","new","york","state","english","language","arts","ela","mathematics","examsgrades","82013","2015notes","starting","2013","the","state","education","department","nysed","changed","the","exams","common","core","aligned","results","earlier","exams","from","2006","2012","can","found","this","link","httpschools","nyc","govnrexeres05289e74","2d81","4cc0","81f6","e1143e28f4c4","frameless","htmresults","presented","here","include","all","students","who","sat","for","either","the","math","ela","exam","the","nysed","website","results","for","matched","students","can","found","account","for","participation","changes","across","years","and","anticipate","the","importance","year","year","same","cohort","comparisons","for","the","class","2022","matched","math","and","ela","results","were","calculated","include","4th","grade","students","who","were","tested","both","the","current","and","previous","year","and","include","5th","8th","grade","students","who","were","tested","all","three","years","in","order","comply","with","ferpa","regulations","public","reporting","education","outcomes","rows","with","fewer","students","are","suppressed","for","2013","district","students","are","represented","their","home","districts","and","boroughs","for","2014","2015","they","are","not","included","charter","schools","are","not","included","school","level","charter","data","can","found","here","httpschools","nyc","govaccountabilitydatatestresultselaandmathtestresultsin","2007","the","new","york","state","education","department","updated","its","testing","policy","for","english","language","learners","ells","english","language","school","system","for","more","than","one","year","are","required","take","the","ela","exam","previously","ells","english","language","school","system","for","less","than","years","were","exempt","from","taking","the","ela","exam","change","state","testing","policy","drove","decrease","eighth","grade","proficiency","rates","2014","reduce","double","testing","most","students","accelerated","math","courses","who","took","the","algebra","regents","exam","were","exempted","from","taking","the","7th","8th","grade","state","math","assessment","former","english","language","learners","includes","any","students","who","were","classified","english","language","learners","least","one","the","previous","two","school","years"],"last-find":{"$date":"2017-07-11T08:10:51.906Z"}},

In addition to the numbers of students earning Advanced Regents Designation on their diplomas, another metric was developed based on performance on Math and ELA Regents exams. The Math/ELA APM represents the percentage of students in the cohort who graduated with any regular diploma (Regents Diploma with Advanced Designation, Regents Diploma, or Local Diploma) and who scored 80 or greater on their highest mathematics Regents and 75 or greater on the English Regents. Since this metric is new for the Class of 2010, only one year of results is reported, separately for June and August graduation cohorts.

Class size is calculated by dividing the number of students in a program and grade by the number of official classes in that program and grade. \r\n\r\nThe following data is excluded from all the reports: District 75 schools, bridge classes which span more than one grade, classes with fewer than five students (for other than special education self-contained classes) and classes with one student (for special education self-contained classes).

The Program benefits both the City and the law firms. The City receives the assistance of an incredibly well-trained and talented group of attorneys while the attorneys receive the kind of hands-on, in-court litigation experience that is often hard to come by at the best private law firms. While participation in the Program will not lead to offers of permanent employment at the Law Department, it will enable the volunteers to keep their skills fresh while serving the public. \r\nTrial Attorney Volunteers: A number of firms lend mid-level litigation associates to the Law Department for a period of four to six months to work full-time in our Tort Division trial units. These attorneys conduct back-to-back civil trials, selecting juries, examining and cross-examining witnesses and presenting opening statements and closing arguments.\r\nLaw Firm Volunteers: Other firms have chosen to take entire matters in-house, giving their attorneys the chance to participate in court conferences, settlement negotiations, depositions, and, ultimately, trials.\r\nDeposition Program: Firms also lend associates to the Law Department either to conduct a series of depositions in an individual case or to spend two to three weeks in our offices conducting back-to-back depositions in a variety of cases.","author":"Law Department (LAW)","link":"https://data.cityofnewyork.us/d/yk6f-pa7p","api-link":"https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/yk6f-pa7p.json","dataset-type":"JSON","url":"https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/yk6f-pa7p.json","meta":["firms_donating_services_since_2007"],"other_tags":["Law Department (LAW)","early","his","tenure","the","law","department","corporation","counsel","michael","cardozo","initiated","the","public","service","program","privatepublic","partnership","with","the","citys","prominent","law","firms","where","firms","either","lend","their","attorneys","the","law","department","for","finite","period","time","agree","take","city","cases","house","the","program","benefits","both","the","city","and","the","law","firms","the","city","receives","the","assistance","incredibly","well","trained","and","talented","group","attorneys","while","the","attorneys","receive","the","kind","hands","court","litigation","experience","that","often","hard","come","the","best","private","law","firms","while","participation","the","program","will","not","lead","offers","permanent","employment","the","law","department","will","enable","the","volunteers","keep","their","skills","fresh","while","serving","the","public","trial","attorney","volunteers","number","firms","lend","mid","level","litigation","associates","the","law","department","for","period","four","six","months","work","full","time","our","tort","division","trial","units","these","attorneys","conduct","back","back","civil","trials","selecting","juries","examining","and","cross","examining","witnesses","and","presenting","opening","statements","and","closing","arguments","law","firm","volunteers","other","firms","have","chosen","take","entire","matters","house","giving","their","attorneys","the","chance","participate","court","conferences","settlement","negotiations","depositions","and","ultimately","trials","deposition","program","firms","also","lend","associates","the","law","department","either","conduct","series","depositions","individual","case","spend","two","three","weeks","our","offices","conducting","back","back","depositions","variety","cases"],"last-find":{"$date":"2017-07-11T08:10:52.122Z"}},
