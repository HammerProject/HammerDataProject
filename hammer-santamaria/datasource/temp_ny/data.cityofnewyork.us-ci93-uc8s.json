Our owner founded Allan's Bakery after friends and neighbors suggested he open a store for his many desserts and pastries. The bakery quickly became popular, and he added a variety of new items to the menu, including an array of breads baked fresh daily.  Today, Allan's Bakery still keeps flavor and quality at the heart of its operation using old-fashioned baking methods with a focus on health and quality rather than convenience. The staff at Allan's Bakery aims to please its customers and counts attentive service among its many attributes, because we realize that a product can only be as good as the people who sell it.  It is our pleasure to share our special treats with your family. If you're in the area, stop by today and taste the difference in person!",
