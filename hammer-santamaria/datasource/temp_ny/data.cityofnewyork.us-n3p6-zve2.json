They begin with introductory research classes in the earlier grades, and grow in complexity as students develop more advanced skills and understanding. Science research, for example, begins in 9th grade with honors experimental research biology, continues with similar high-level courses in chemistry & physics, and culminates in the senior Intel/Siemens research competition class. In addition, a wide array of science electives enhances students' academic opportunities in these field. This highly successful sequential approach has resulted in 13 Intel semifinalists (and the 3rd-place national winner) in 2012 and ten semifinalists in 2013, leading the nation in this category for both years., Chancellor’s Arts Endorsed Diploma",

Newly-built science and engineering labs offer up-to-date equipment, and all classrooms have internet access and computers or laptop carts. Students are drawn from all five boroughs of NYC and hail from diverse ethnic backgrounds. When students graduate, they are prepared for college and for life beyond by HSMSE’s in-depth approach to learning.

In addition to the challenging academic work offered, we are also committed to providing learning opportunities outside of the classroom. Throughout the year, our students participate in regular field trips to arts institutions, colleges and universities. During the summer, our student services team connects students to jobs, internships and programs that allow them to travel all over the world – from Tokyo to Mexico. At Letters, we celebrate hard work, curiosity, self-expression and service. Our graduates are articulate, critical readers and writers, fully prepared to maximize their learning and growth – not only during their high school and college years, but throughout their lives.",

With millions of dollars in scholarships earned by our seniors each year, internships for students starting freshman year and students moving on to prestigious universities like Fordham, NYU, St. John’s and Penn State, the question shouldn't be, 'Why should I attend Truman?' but rather, 'Why would I go anywhere else?'

Our classes are small and our academic program is challenging, with the expectation that students have a successful, timely transition out of the ESL program and graduate in four years. Students share their native cultures and languages and learn to become active citizens in their new country as they adapt to and flourish in American culture and in their use of the English language. Our staff works closely with students to ensure progress throughout the high school years and as they continue their education and/or join the world of work.",

  "overview_paragraph" : "Juan Morel Campos Secondary School works to balance experiences in the arts with college readiness activities for all students. Every student at Campos takes daily talent classes of their choice; students become musicians, singers, dancers, actors, and visual artists. Partnerships with major community arts organizations and the College Bound Initiative (CBI) ensure that students also connect their learning to the real world. For example, students conduct gallery openings at professional galleries throughout the city and begin visiting colleges as freshmen. In addition, an in-house CBI counselor ensures that students are prepared for college acceptance and enrollment upon graduation. We are small enough to give every student the attention they deserve while being large enough to offer a wide variety of courses and activities during and after the school day. Beginning early in high school, students at Campos visit colleges, earn college credits through AP and CUNY courses, play sports, take on leadership roles, participate in a wide variety of after-school activities, learn about careers in the arts, and are surrounded by teams of adults who offer all of the academic and social support they need to succeed in school. We are prepared to serve any student and value a diverse and richly talented school community.",

Our emphasis is on project-based learning that challenges students to question, discuss, collaborate and solve problems—a curriculum that prepares students to be competitive scholars and citizens in the modern world. The arts, critical literacy, and technology are infused into all that we do, and students are challenged to be critical and creative thinkers, problem-solvers and active participants and leaders in our community. We believe that technological skills are critical to students’ future success; every classroom is equipped with Smartboards, Document Cameras, and multiple computers, so our students are developing 21st century technology skills in every class. SCCS is also housed in a brand-new, state-of-the-art building that benefits from a professional auditorium, cutting-edge science and computer labs, art and music rooms and a full-scale gymnasium. We believe that the key to achievement is to involve not only our students but also their families—parents appreciate our focus on collaboration and communication, and can expect regular contact with our school.",

This great tradition and the legacy of our namesake still resonate at Lincoln today. Abraham Lincoln High School is a community where all members help one another pursue their potential. Through our partnership with Johns Hopkins University's Talent Development High Schools, we offer Small Learning Communities (SLC). Our ninth and tenth grade Academies feature a block schedule in which teams of teachers meet with guidance counselors to discuss and support each student's academic performance and socio-emotional development. The first two years at Lincoln are dedicated to meeting high school graduation requirements, while the junior and senior years in the upper academies are devoted to college and career readiness in the sciences or humanities. Lincoln provides students with the individualized attention of SLC, as well as the assets, resources, and facilities of a large comprehensive high school. We offer a state-of-the-art photography studio, two animal science labs, a vast library, multiple computer labs, spacious grounds, three gymnasiums and a swimming pool. Our extensive elective course offerings, including Advanced Placement and College Now classes, empower our academic achievers to complete up to a year of college credit during their secondary studies. Lincoln is a school where students have every opportunity to pursue their potential.",
