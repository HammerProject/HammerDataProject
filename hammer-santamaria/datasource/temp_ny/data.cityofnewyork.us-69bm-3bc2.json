At the same time, it helps offenders address underlying problems, such as homelessness, unemployment, and substance abuse, by linking them to on-site social services such as mental health counseling, job training, and drug treatment.

  "description" : "Protecting and promoting our industrial sector is crucial to the city's overall economic development. In January 2005, Mayor Bloomberg created the Office of Industrial and Manufacturing Businesses to retain and grow the sector's job base, execute the goals of the industrial policy, and serve as a single point of coordination for the industrial and manufacturing sector. The sector provides close to 500,000 jobs in New York City, making up nearly 15% of the city's workforce, and contributed $1.7 billion in tax revenues in 2004. The manufacturing and industrial sector is not only a strong component of our economy but a reliable source of jobs for many of our fellow New Yorkers. More than half of the employees in the industrial sector have a high school diploma or less and nearly a fifth have limited English proficiency. New York City is a strategic location to operate an industrial business. The unparalleled concentration of residents, businesses, economic activity, and wealth creates a tremendous end market for the industrial sector. Every employer praises the New York City workforce for its unparalleled diversity, depth of talent, commitment, and proactive attitude. Despite these advantages, challenges remain for the sector. Space to expand or relocate is expensive and scarce, operating costs are high, and there is a perception that the overall business environment presents obstacles. Our Office has begun to address these issues. Our Office broadened the Commercial Expansion Program to create benefits especially for industrial and manufacturing businesses that rent their spaces. In early 2006 our Office created 16 Industrial Business Zones across the City where expanded business services are available for industrial and manufacturing businesses. A relocation tax credit of $1,000 per employee is offered for manufacturing and industrial businesses that choose to relocate within the Industrial Business Zones.ï¿½ Moreover, the zones represent areas where the Bloomberg Administration guarantees it will prohibit any new residential development. And State tax credits are also available to qualified businesses located in certain Industrial Business Zones as a result of the recent reconfiguration of the New York City's Empire Zones. Our Office intends to see these initiatives grow and better serve the cityï¿½s industrial and manufacturing businesses. We encourage you to explore this site to learn more. Please contact us to let us know how we can help you.",

  "description" : "Mayor Bloomberg and Schools Chancellor Klein launched Children First, a new vision for New York City public schools, in 2003. Through Children First, the Mayor and Chancellor sought to fundamentally transform the school system they inherited in 2002 when the State Legislature granted the Mayor control of the school system. They aimed to transform a system that had allowed generations of students to leave school without the skills and knowledge they needed to succeed, turning it into a system of 1,400-plus excellent schools, capable of helping the Cityï¿½s 1.1 million school children learn the skills and receive the support they deserve and need to succeed. Mayor Bloomberg and Chancellor Klein believe education reform requires a comprehensive and integrated plan, involving changes in strategy, leadership, management, people, and programming. Three inter-related principles are the driving forces behind the Children First reforms: leadership, empowerment, and accountability. Schools need strong leaders who are empowered to make decisions and who are accountable for results.",

  "description" : "The Office of Chief Medical Examiner of the City of New York (OCME)was established in 1918 pursuant to a 1915 Act of the New York State Legislature. In addition to being the first governmental agency of its type in the United States, OCME established the first toxicology laboratory in 1918 and the first serology laboratory in 1938, both at Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan. In 1933, New York University established the first Department of Forensic Medicine in the country. Since that date, Medical Examiners at OCME have held faculty positions in NYU's Forensic Medicine department. OCME's administrative offices were in the Municipal Building from 1918 to 1934, and at 125 Worth Street from 1934 to 1960; autopsies were performed at Bellevue Hospital and other borough municipal hospitals during those years. In 1960, OCME's six-story headquarters at 520 First Avenue (northeast corner of First Avenue and 30th Street) opened on land provided by New York University, adjacent to NYU Medical Center. In 1968 the Institute of Forensic Medicine of New York University and the City of New York was created; in 1977 the Institute was named after the late Milton Helpern, Chief Medical Examiner from 1954 to 1973. The Institute is comprised of OCME, the New York University School of Medicine, and the New York University College of Dentistry. OCME's headquarters at 520 First Avenue houses executive offices, the mortuary, autopsy rooms, X-Ray/photography facilities, as well as toxicology and histology laboratories. In February 2007, OCME opened the OCME DNA Building located at 421 East 26 Street (east of First Avenue), which houses state of the art Forensic Biology laboratories, as well as OCMEï¿½s Administrative unit and Evidence facilities including a forensic garage to examine vehicles for forensic evidence.",

A job provides a participant with much more than financial independence. It brings about fundamental and permanent changes including improvements in parenting, child development, housing, nutrition, health care and education (of parents and children). Moreover, these improvements greatly benefit the communities and regions where STRIVE graduates live by adding to consumer spending, increasing tax rolls and lowering public support. The accomplishment of these outcomes, pursued with the backing of funders having related objectives, will always be STRIVEâ€™s purpose.",

  "description" : "Founded in 1876, The Legal Aid Society is the nation's oldest and largest not-for-profit organization providing high quality legal services to low-income families and individuals in New York City.  The Legal Aid Society is an indispensable component of the legal, social, and economic fabric of New York City-- passionately advocating for individuals across a variety of civil, criminal and juvenile rights matters, while also fighting for legal reform.  The Legal Aid Society has performed this role in the city, state and federal courts for over 130 years.  It does so by capitalizing on the diverse expertise, experience and capabilities of 850 of the brightest legal minds.  It works with 600 social workers, investigators, paralegals, and support and administrative staff in every borough of the city.  It takes on more cases for more clients than any other organization in New York City.  And it brings a depth and breadth of perspective that is unmatched in the legal profession.  The Legal Aid Society at the vanguard of the cause of equal justice under law for all people. Its unique value is an ability to go beyond any one case to create more equitable outcomes for individuals and broader, more powerful systemic change for society as a whole.  The Legal Aid Society operates through a network of borough, neighbohood and courthouse offices in 25 locations in New York City and provides comprehensive legal services in all five boroughs free of charge for clients who cannot afford to pay for counsel.  In addition to the three major practices: Civil, Criminal and Juvenile Rights, The Legal Aid Society receives volunteer help from law firms and corporate law departments that is coordinated by the Pro Bono Practice.  The Legal Aid Society handles more than 295,000 cases and legal matters for clients each year. The Civil Practice handles more than 30,000 client matters providing assistance to the most vulnerable New Yorkers, including senior citizens, chronically ill or disabled children and adults, survivors of domestic violence, immigrants, low-wage or unemployed workers, persons living with HIV/AIDS, and homeless or imminently homeless children and adults.   The Criminal Practice, the primary provider of indigent defense services in New York City, is comprised of trial offices in the four major boroughs, an Appeals Bureau, a Parole Revocvation Defense Unit, an Adolescent Intervention and Diversion Unit and a MICA Unit for mentally ill, chemically addicted clients. The Criminal Practice handles a total of 235,000 cases. The Juvenile Rights Practice's core client service is the representation of children in Family Court in abuse and neglect cases, juvenile delinquency matters, and persons in need of supervision.  The Practice handles approximatley 90 percnt of these cases in the Family Court and  represents more than 30,000 children.",

  "description" : "Women's Project is the nation's oldest and largest company dedicated to  producing and promoting theater created by women, and providing a stage for women?s perspectives on a wide variety of political, social, religious, and cultural topics. Women's Project was founded in 1978 by Julia Miles to address the conspicuous under-representation of women artists in the American theater. Now entering its fourth decade under the leadership of Julie Crosby, countless artists have achieved significant recognition through WP productions, including Anne Bogart, Eve Ensler, Lynn Nottage, Maria Irene Fornes, Rinne Groff, Suzan-Lori Parks, Naomi Wallace, and Anna Deavere Smith, among the many. During its 31 years, WP has staged over 600 mainstage productions and developmental projects, and published ten anthologies of plays. Women's Project mentors talented artists through its free, intensive Directors, Playwrights, and Producers Labs, and reaches over 2,000 students annually through Ten Centuries of Women Playwrights, an award-winning arts education program. In 1998, Women?s Project purchased a historic off-Broadway venue christened the Julia Miles Theater in 2004 on Manhattan's West 55th Street, making WP the first and only women's theater company to hold the keys to its own stage.",

  "description" : "Originally established as a substitute educational program in the wake of the 1968 New York City teachers' strike, the agency presently provides educational, employment, recreational and cultural programs for over 3,000 youth on a year-round basis.  Additionally, CASW bears the distinction of conducting the neighborhood's only year-round, after-school and weekend training workshops in dance, music, art, science and martial arts.  CASW strives to reach those youth with fragile family support systems; the vast majority of whom are recently arrived immigrants.  We also provide strong academic support for those who are at-risk of dropping out of school through our after-school tutoring and basic skills instruction.  Through numerous activities that build self-reliance and conflict resolution skills, youth are taught to cope with the negative influences that confront them on a daily basis.   Our programs and services provide a holistic approach to the needs of youth and their families.  All participants receive an in depth interview to help us assess their needs and determine if they need to be referred to other social service agencies that would better address their particular need(s) or problem(s).",

  "description" : "Crown Heights Jewish Community Council (CHJCC) is a private, nonprofit social service agency serving one of the most diverse and challenging neighborhoods in New York City. The agency was formed in 1969 in response to deteriorating social and economic conditions in the neighborhood. The population of the 116-city block cache area known as Crown Heights is comprised of persons of many cultures and includes new immigrants. According to the 1990 census, incomes tend to be low - often below poverty levels. Housing is mostly old (circa 1900 - 1930) and at a premium. CHJCC administers programs, advocates for clients, and provides referrals on issues of housing, employment, economic development, entitlements, problems of the aging, aid to crime victims, assistance for indigent residents. CHJCC has created multi-racial, faith, and community-based programs such as Project Care, which unites civic and religious leaders from every segment of the community in a funded program to promote efforts in social and economic development. Creative initiatives such as Project Care have addressed areas of common concern, and new avenues of communication and cooperation have emerged. One of the major goals of the CHJCC is to promote an atmosphere of understanding and cooperation in the community. Areas of common concern, including housing, poverty, crime, employment, education and economic development, are being addressed through new programs.",

Through these mediums, Rocking the Boat enables South Bronx students to deal with everyday realities that are often not addressed at home or in school. Five levels of community and youth development programs operate during the fall and spring academic semesters and over the summer. Together, the programs directly serve over 2,000 students and community members drawn from a range of New York City public middle schools, high schools and neighborhoods, the majority being in the South Bronx. Kids don't just build boats at Rocking the Boat, boats build kids.",

Publishing since 1976 (!) the magazine brings you information about stuff you've probably had tickling the edges of your consciousness but never read about in a magazine before: New rituals and celebrations for a wedding ceremony, for childbirth, for turning 12, or 20, or 60. Feminist additions to your Passover seder and a new prayerbook for everyday. Role models you've never met before. Foremothers. Jewish hair (YES!). What's different about Jewish women's attitudes to food. Reviews of books, plays, films, music and videos. The best new poetry and fiction. Pages of resource listings in every issue - where to go for what if you're Jewish and female.",

We hold parenting skills training and group discussions to help parents understand child development and to acquire skills that will help them improve their family relationships. Youth 3) Youth Project. Facilitates the creation of a space where youth can develop skills that will allow them to make collective contributions to their community, as well as providing them with opportunities for their own personal development. Our mission is based on the philosophy of elevating social consciousness to empower people through community organizing. In each project people find opportunities to achieve their potentials and the motivation to fight for their rights. This is achieved by collective learning, collaboration, and direct action.",

  "description" : "Voces Latinas (VL) started it's work in 2003 as part of the Western Queens HIV Care Network. A group of certified social workers in the HIV field who were also part of the Network were concerned about the high rates of HIV among women of color, particularly immigrant Latinas, as there exists a gap in services for this hard to reach population due to immigration status, documentation status, language barrier, and cultural norms. Voces Latinas saw a need for more outreach, education, advocacy and resources in Spanish for this population. VL began raising money in order to hold conferences and forums in Queens targeting immigrant Latinas living with and at risk for HIV. This was an opportunity to invite the HIV specialist to come to Queens and talk to the population at hand, as it is often impossible for these women to attend conferences often times held in English and in other parts of the country. The response to the conferences and forums was so positive that Voces Latinas began holding bi-monthly community workshops around issues placing Latinas at high risk for HIV/AIDS such as domestic violence, alcohol and substance abuse, depression, etc. These workshops quickly turned weekly. The workshops continue to be held weekly and also serve to provide an opportunity for Latinas to meet and provide each other emotional support and an opportunity to tell their stories, which for many of them is the first time ever openly talking about their lives.",

  "description" : "CAAAV: Organizing Asian Communities (also known as Committee Against Anti-Asian Violence) was founded by Asian women in 1986 as one of the first organizations in the United States to mobilize Asian communities to counter anti-Asian violence. CAAAV focuses on institutional violence that affects immigrant working-class communities such as worker exploitation, concentrated urban poverty, police brutality, Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) detention and deportation, and criminalization of workers and youth. By organizing across diverse, low-wage and poor Asian communities in New York City, CAAAV exposes and struggles against violence with the goal of building community capacity to exercise self-determination. Building coalitions enables CAAAV to contribute to a unified strategy for a broader, multi-racial and multi-issue movement for social change. CAAAV is a volunteer-driven organization led by members of low-income Asian immigrant communities.",

  "description" : "The Chinese-American Planning Council, then known as the Chinatown Planning Council, was founded in 1965 as a grassroots community-based organization in response to the tremendous influx of Chinese immigrants after the change in immigration laws, and in the midst of the Great Society movement. Initially, CPC volunteers counseled families referred by local schools, and provided case management services to help immigrants adjust to their new homes. Filling a void in the community as the first social service agency to serve Chinese-Americans in New York, CPC began to expand its services based on the needs expressed by those in the community.",

Genesis (Small Group Bonding), Exodus (The Blessing of Torah), Leviticus (Ritual and Spirituality), Numbers (Making A Better Society), Deuteronomy (Bonding with all types of Jews.) We at CAI are proud of our role as a leading and pro-active egalitarian Conservative congregation that embodies these five principles in a pluralistic manner for all ages and stages of Jewish living. We provide an extraordinary variety of religious, educational, cultural and recreational venues, planned jointly and pro-actively by an exemplary professional staff and an engaged lay leadership. We help our diverse and multi-generational membership to experience Judaism in ways that have personal meaning and promote Jewish values for people moving through the Jewish life cycle. We seek to enable our members to ascend \"the ladder of Jewish commitment\" at their own pace, feeling more and more part of our \"second home\" as a CAI family.",

  "description" : "Our work prioritizes connecting workersâ€™ individual struggles for daily survival into a collective force to change the root causes of these problems in all aspects of workersâ€™ lives. In response to the super-exploitation that many workers face on a daily basis, and to the multiple barriers of race, gender, age, and immigration status that often compound exploitation, we emphasize developing leadership among working people in NYCâ€™s Chinatowns and to bridge the divides within the Chinese community and beyond; we believe working people, as the creators of society will be the agent for change. Based on a workersâ€™ center model, we tackle â€œbread and butterâ€ issues, some as well as land-use and displacement, childcare, health, youth development, immigration, and 9/11 disaster relief assistance. CSWA sees itself as engaging in and leading a new labor movement to address new socio-economic realities that traditional labor organizing models are unable to address- widespread sweatshop conditions intensified by the U.S. modern day slave law employersâ€™ sanctions. From workplace to community struggles, we continue to grow into our 30th year to organize working people to fight for the control of our time, our space, and our lives.",

  "description" : "A statewide, parent-governed, non-profit organization, grew out of the efforts of many people who were concerned about children's mental health services in New York State and across the nation. A 1990 study by Dr. Brandenburg estimated that of the general population of children in the U.S., about 14% (between 9.5 and 13.6 million children), have an emotional, behavioral or mental disorder. In that same year, the New York State Office of Mental Health (OMH) reported 19,000 children being served, and another 19,000 waiting for services in state operated programs alone. These were alarming numbers.",

We are the oldest continuing feminist publisher in the world; our existence is grounded in the knowledge that mainstream publishers seeking mass audiences often ignore important, path-breaking works by women from the United States and throughout the world. Founded in 1970, the Press launched the contemporary rediscovery of  lost  American women writers, and went on to diversify its list by publishing significant works by American women writers of color. More recently, the Press has added to its roster international women writers who are still far less likely to be translated than male writers.",
