The body septum approach provides the necessary back ground information and refreshes the student's memory of previously learned material through which the therapeutic action for the drug can be clearly understood. The discussion of each drug classification concentrates on the mechanism of action main therapeutic effects  clinical indication  adverse reactions and drug interactions. Patient information on absorption  metabolism excretion adn other special considerations are also discussed for each medication category. The chapter reviews at the end of each chapter provide immediate reinforcement of terminology and pharmacological concepts important for acquiring knowledge and the clinically relevant on the job questions allow students more opportunity to practice critical thinking skills..

  "coursedescription" : "This class is designed to provide an introduction to both the Ruby language and the Rails framework. In the very first exercise  you will build a fully functioning Rails app  and you'll have the basic tools and knowledge to enhance and grow it. You'll also learn how to version your changes and collaborate with Git. Next we'll take a look at just what makes the Ruby language so special  emphasizing Ruby's heavily object-oriented design to build custom classes and extend them. After that we'll dive into ActiveRecord  Rails's unrivaled data modeling engine  and then you'll learn how to engage your site's visitors with that data using ActionView and ActionController..Testing is an important part of Rails development (some people say it's the most important part) and you'll learn how to work with Rails's test suite&mdash;and see how it can make building and updating complex sites a breeze. Finally we'll see how to extend Rails with additional plugins from the community.There's a lot to learn about Ruby on Rails  so this class assumes you are comfortable with HTML  CSS  and JavaScript. Prior experience with other programming languages (PHP  Java  or C++) can also be beneficial..Students will receive a certificate of completion upon finishing the course.See our website for course dates and times: http://www.nobledesktop.com/schedule.cfm.",
