Dance: Come dressed in proper dance attire consisting of leotard, tights, and ballet shoes with hair placed in a bun (girls) or black jazz pants and white tee shirt (boys). Auditioning students will take a ballet barre led by the teacher. Auditioning students will have the opportunity to present a short one minute dance of your choice and bring your own music. Drama: Prepare two contrasting memorized monologues from a play, movie or novel, each one minute long. You may be asked to participate in a group theater game. Instrumental Music: This program offers a jazz curriculum for students who play band and rhythm section instruments. We do not have a string program. Students must bring their own instrument, sticks and music to the audition. Be prepared to play a scale and selection of music from a book or solo of your own choice, and sight-read. You will complete a questionnaire, interview, and take a simple test for musical aptitude. Vocal Music: Perform a prepared song without CD/piano accompaniment from the following list: Amazing Grace, Simple Gifts, The National Anthem (Star Spangled Banner), My Favorite Things, God Bless America, Happy Birthday and Somewhere. Students should avoid Top 40 or Pop music when at all possible. Applicants will also be evaluated on tonal memory, rhythmic and aural skills and vocal technique through teacher-led vocal exercises. Visual Art: Prepare and present a professional portfolio (work completed on drawing paper, canvas or photographed) of at least five pieces of original work drawn from real-life observations (including one self-portrait, one still-life and one landscape). The portfolio needs to show a range of style. Sketchbooks are welcomed as extra drawings.

Cornell University, our lead partner, brings expertise in science, sustainable food production, nutrition, and other topics. Students develop critical thinking skills while engaged in projects, portfolio development, internships, and entrepreneurial ventures. In addition to the state endorsed CTE diploma, students are expected to take a series of industry-recognized certification examinations.",

Asking the right questions is equally as important as knowing the right answers.
