Additionally, each student is ensured to excel on the Regents due to the rigorous curriculum, after-school tutoring and weekend preparation programs that the school also offers. Besides having a rigorous curriculum and academic supports, all students are pushed to participate in the numerous after school programs the school offers, such as the newspaper and yearbook clubs, The National Honor Society, PSAL sports teams, robotics, dance, choir, and various other program options. CPEHS students also have the opportunity to engage in an assortment of community service opportunities, ranging from volunteering in soup kitchens, helping out at the ING marathon, or assisting the elderly. Once students enter their senior year, they are well prepared for their SAT with access to a variety of prep programs, and their college application process is carefully overseen by our college counselor. Students are also rewarded with multiple trips, school events, and honors.",

Our staff effort is guided by our shared love of teaching and learning, combined with our recognition of educational possibilities rooted in the interplay of arts and academics. We always look forward to asking our students to \"show me what you know\" and having the answers surprise, confirm, and delight. This school year we are working with the Lehman College of Education as one of a select group of sites to help develop and mentor new teachers in conjunction with our qualified teaching staff. Fordham University's CFN 551 is our support network. We have a theater scene shop, dedicated dance studio, black box theater, full-sized auditorium, two vocal chorus rooms, and a radio station. We communicate with students and parents through our school website, daily morning and afternoon announcements, monthly Town Hall meetings, our TAPCo radio station, an active Parent Association, weekly student meetings with staff agents, and an open door policy for all administration. TAPCo also just held our inaugural Student Council elections to give students voice and experience in the democratic process. TAPCo celebrates student success through commemorating all student work via video and photographs, awards assemblies, and our recently formed National Honor Society. Pay us a visit and you'll learn how our community lives up to the highest behavioral and academic standards. We provide a safe, nurturing and stimulating environment for all students.",

Our current students and their parents will tell you that we have taken the \"small school feeling\" of intimate classes, teachers who know you by name, and the time and personal attention needed to achieve success - and combined it with the variety of courses, diverse student body and world-class facilities that you can only get in a large high school environment. We've even received awards for our work in this rebuilding. Our students not only get their core academic courses, but can also choose to focus on one of six career academies. With millions of dollars in scholarships earned by our seniors each year, internships for students starting freshman year, and students moving on to prestigious universities like Fordham, NYU, St. Johns and Penn State, the question shouldn't be \"Why should I attend Truman?\" but rather, \"Why would I go anywhere else?\" It's class-leading education, close to home. If it sounds too good to be true, come and visit for yourself.",

As an inquiry-based school, we use collaborative approaches that benefit students by teaching them skills they'll need beyond high school, such as the ability to work in teams, to solve multi-faceted problems, and apply what they learn in various settings. In order for our inquiry-based approach to be successful, our class sizes are smaller, with approximately twenty-two students per academic course, and our class times are longer; core courses are ninety minutes long on alternating days. We have planned an extended school day to provide structured time, individual attention, and other supports students may need to succeed. Bronxdale follows a Distributed Counseling model through which students learn to develop relationships and build community, leading to overall student success. Each student is assigned an advisor and becomes part of an Advisory group. Bronxdale High School will help each child develop the critical thinking skills and habits of work necessary for post-secondary success.",

This great tradition and the legacy of our namesake still resonate at Lincoln today. Abraham Lincoln High School is a community where all members help one another pursue their potential. Through our partnership with Johns Hopkins University's Talent Development High Schools, we offer Small Learning Communities (SLC). Our ninth and tenth grade Academies feature a block schedule in which teams of teachers meet with guidance counselors to track and support each student's academic performance and socio-emotional development. The first two years at Lincoln are dedicated to meeting high school graduation requirements, while the junior and senior years in the upper academies are devoted to college and career readiness in the sciences or humanities. Lincoln provides students with the individualized attention of Small Learning Communities, as well as the assets, resources, and facilities of a large comprehensive high school. We offer a state-of-the-art photography studio, two animal science labs, a vast library, multiple computer labs, spacious grounds, three gymnasiums and a swimming pool. Our extensive elective course offerings, including Advanced Placement and College Now classes, empower our academic achievers to complete up to a year of college credit during their secondary studies. Lincoln is the school where students have every opportunity to pursue their potential.",

Our goal is to infuse social, technological and analytical skills in order to facilitate the development of the next generation of leaders in society. Our collaborative approach to education fosters a supportive community which raises the performance level of each individual. In our labs and classrooms, students learn by doing. Skilled and committed faculty teach with rigor and with passion for their subjects. Housed in a dedicated building on The City College of New York campus, HSMSE gives students an early taste of college life as they eat in the college cafeteria and study in the college library. Newly built science and engineering labs offer up-to-date equipment, and all classrooms have internet access and computers or laptop carts. Students are drawn from all five boroughs of NYC and hail from diverse ethnic backgrounds. When students graduate, they are prepared for college and for life beyond by HSMSE's in-depth approach to learning. New York State Regents exams, while required, are viewed as minimal competencies which our students are expected to master. Our curriculum exceeds the state standards in every way. Most HSMSE courses are taught at the advanced, AP and college level, and some courses earn college credit from The City College of New York. Students select one of three concentrations at the end of 10th grade, taking advanced coursework in either Advanced Engineering, Biomedical Research or Mathematics in 11th and 12th grades. HSMSE also offers a variety of elective classes and academic teams across departments. The school day is from 8:00 AM to 3:35 PM",
