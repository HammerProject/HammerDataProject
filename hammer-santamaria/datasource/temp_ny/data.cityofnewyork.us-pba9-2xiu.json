  "description" : "The combination of the recession and the impact of the destruction of the World Trade Center is clearly reflected in the City's financial condition. Over the past 15 months the City has implemented a $4.6 billion in FY 2004 gap-closing actions, including an 18.5 percent property tax increase while borrowing $2 billion to meet operating expenses. However, there was still a FY 2004 deficit of at least $3.8 billion. The Mayor proposed a series of actiosn to close the gap, which include $1.4 billion in new taxes, more than $1.1 billion in State aid above current projections, and $620 million in agency gap-closing initiatives. The State Legislature has approved a state budget and associated initiatives. If enacted into law, it will assist the City in balancing its own budget. The ongoing dispute between the Governor and the State Legislature over the State budget, along with the risks in the Executive Budget could result in another round of cutbacks and layoffs.",

  "description" : "The City is likely to end FY 2003 with its budget in blaance and with a small surplus available to offset FY 2004 expenditures. Gap-closing actions implemented since November 2002 will reduce the FY 2004 deficit by $3.2 billion, however, the City still projects a $3.4 billion deficit. Analysis suggests that the problem could be $500 million larger than the City estimates. It is unlikely that a near-term resurgence in the local economy will help reduce next year's budget deficit. The Governor's recently proposed Executive Budget would increase the City's fiscal burdens rather than reduce them. If the proposals are to be enacted, they would increase the City's FY 2004 budget gap by over $800 million. If the Federal and State government refuse to offer meaningful assistance and City unions do not offer savings proposals, the City will be forced to adopt draconian budgetary measures.",

  "description" : "Despite a projected gap of $1.1 billion in FY 2003, it appears that the City will end the current FY in balance. The budget stabilization account (BSA) and the general reserve will provide the City with a comfortable cushion against any shortfalls in the budget. The outlook for FY 2004 and the outyears of the financial plan shows a lackluster stock market and the 9/11 attacks continue to take their toll on the City's fiscal condition. The City has devised a comprehensive gap-closing program to balance the budget in 2003 and 2004 and reduce the outyear gaps. The increased property tax rate is expected to generate revenues of $838 million in FY 2003 , but this lower than expected increase has reduced the expected FY 2003 surplus roll. However, the Federal government needs to support the City's effort to overcome its fiscal difficulty and labor must work with the City to lower spending on personal services.",

This grants the Cyclones the exclusive rights to use KeySpan Park on Surf Avenue in Brooklyn. This audit determined whether the Cyclones complied with their lease agreement with the City; paid  the appropriate fees to the City and whether they paid them on time. The Cyclones paid the City $1,131,196 in rental  fees and Parks paid the Cyclones $200,000 related to net parking lot income. Audit findings include the significant weakness in the Cyclones internal controls that prevented the determination of whether actual attendance, no-shows, and recreated area attendees were reported accurately, and whether all appropriate fees due the City were paid. The Cyclones did not report $98,600 recorded on their books as rent revenue, therefore owe the City $49,300 in additional fees. The audit recommends to base actual attendance on their turnstile counts, as required by the lease, along with other recommendations.",
