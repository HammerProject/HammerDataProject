By using the arts as a teaching tool and providing students with means to express themselves, UASPA breathes creativity into all subjects and builds confidence in all students. At UASPA, we believe that all students deserve access to a rigorous academic and artistic high school experience; we do not audition our students and we attract students from all five boroughs who may not have had previous access to artistic study. We have partnerships with key organizations, such as Tony Bennett Foundation/Exploring the Arts, Martha Graham Dance Company, EPIC Theatre Ensemble, and The Collegiate Chorale that support our teachers with improving instruction by integrating the arts into their classrooms and providing students with exceptional art and career-based learning experiences. At UASPA, we believe that “education equals options,” meaning that students’ education and knowledge will provide them with the skills necessary to pursue the post-secondary path of their choice, whether that be in the arts or in another field.",

We promote community-building among students, staff, and parents. As a school community, we practice Restorative Justice to address social-emotional challenges and use Circles to address conflict. All students are encouraged to pursue academic excellence and artistic achievement. Teaching artists, in collaboration with classroom teachers, develop arts-integrated projects throughout the year. We currently have an International Travel Program where students can travel to Amsterdam and Barcelona. Students have opportunities in their junior year to spend time on college campuses in the summer, and we conduct college visits starting in 9th grade. Our arts electives and majors include visual art, dance, digital media, choral music, theatre, and musical theatre.",

We have received awards for our work in this rebuilding. Our students not only get their core academic courses, but can also commit to one of six career academies. With millions of dollars in scholarships earned by our seniors each year, internships for students starting freshman year and students moving on to prestigious universities like Fordham, NYU, St. John’s, and Penn State, the question shouldn’t be, ‘Why should I attend Truman?’ but rather, ‘Why would I go anywhere else?’ It is a class-leading education, close to home.

Partnerships with major community arts organizations, CUNY’s PERC program, and the College Bound Initiative (CBI) ensure that students also connect their learning to the real world and have the opportunity to teach and learn from one another. For example, students conduct gallery openings at professional galleries throughout the city, co-teach STEM classes with teachers in the PERC program, and begin visiting colleges as ninth graders. In addition, an in-house college counselor ensures that students are prepared for college acceptance and enrollment upon graduation. We are small enough to give every student the attention they deserve while being large enough to offer a wide variety of courses and activities during and after the school day. Beginning early in high school, students at Campos visit colleges, earn college credits through Advanced Placement (AP) and CUNY courses, play sports, take on leadership roles, participate in a wide variety of after-school activities, learn about careers in the arts, and are surrounded by teams of adults who offer all of the academic and social support they need to succeed in school.

In the ninth and tenth grades, PBATs take the form of roundtables: presentations in a small group of students in which students present a final piece of work to staff, families, and visitors. In eleventh and twelfth grades, they are semester-long projects that show a deep understanding of one aspect of a given content in history, science, English, or math. Students also meet with their faculty advisor regularly to discuss academic goals and progress. A wide array of elective classes allows students to pursue their individual academic interests and goals.

Social studies professional development through the Urban Memory Project enables teachers to engage students in projects and seminars culminating in our Senior Brooklyn History exhibit.
