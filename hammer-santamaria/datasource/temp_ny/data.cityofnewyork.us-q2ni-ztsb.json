In order to keep the fees as low as possible, we need your help. This is where you, the parents, come in. As we all know parents play a major role in everything that their child does, and we hope that you will show the same eagerness to support our league that you do other aspects of your child’s life.  Being involved, takes effort, commitment, and a healthy dose of patience. It also means shuttling your children back and forth to practices and sneaking out of work early to attend games – but that’s just the beginning.  \r\n",

Trainees also practice large-scale painting and plastering by donating their services to other non-profits. Monthly field trips to museums and showhouses help trainees to see the decorative arts in context while work readiness courses prepare them to return to employment. Trainees receive a 100 weekly stipend and must attend 455 hours of class and complete a full portfolio of samples to graduate.

These productions, which are free and open to the public, nurture our young actors, and provide opportunities for emerging playwrights and directors, while also affording an opportuity to those who may not have the means to attend other live cultural events. Funding will be used specifically to purchase materials for sets, properties and costumes, to offset the costs of design and construction, and to provide additional publicity materials for greater community outreach. The history of the American Academy of Dramatic Arts is interwoven with the history of American theatre and world cinema and our alumni have been an invaluable resource to the local community, !\r\n providing skill and talent for the Broadway and Off-Broadway stages. To date our alumni have, collectively, been nominated for 84 Tony Awards",

  "purpose_of_funds" : "El Museo in the Classroom – Around the Block Around the Block (ATB) is an innovative three-session program that seeks to deepen the understanding of the relationship between the museum and its neighborhood.  El Museo’s teaching artists work with students to explore the museum’s Permanent Collection and temporary exhibitions, and the history and culture of El Barrio and its residents in a walking tour of the neighborhood. Students will learn and discuss ways in which neighborhoods have been shaped by both the cultural and social practices of its residents, focusing both on El Barrio and their own neighborhoods. The ATB art making activities will extend learning about our relationship with our community and involve critical reflection upon the role each student and their own cultural traditions and practices have in their own ‘barrios.’  Their final projects are included in El Museo’s annual Youth Art Show, held annually in the spring.  \r\n",

We provide specialized dance and theater instruction to support communication and language skills to 1,100 fourth and fifth graders in 11 Queens schools.

Our work at PS 38 began in 1979, the founding year of year our organization.  Thanks to our longstanding partnership, the arts have become central to the school’s culture.  This year, 3rd grade students studied African dance with Andrea Markus, accompanied by djembe drummer Brian Glashow. Andrea collaborated with the classroom teachers to develop integrated arts programs that met students’ needs and made curricular connections, aligning with a social studies unit on Africa. Students reflected on how dance functions within their own and other cultures.

Through fun academic activities, students practice the lessons they learned in school and receive personalized attention for questions.  Last year, in a school where 48 of the students are English Language Learners, 59 of the APEX students were proficient in ELA and 90 were proficient in Math. After class, the 4th graders are joined by the 5th graders and they are mentored by 10-15 volunteer coaches who teach them the fundamentals of basketball.  The program allows youth to connect with positive adult role models from outside the community who they can aspire to be.  \r\n\r\nThe funds requested will support the essential staff needed to organize the youth and volunteers, background checks for the volunteers and supplies.",

  "purpose_of_funds" : "The program to be funded provides 25-30 John Dewey High School students with public speaking classes for 15 sessions. These students are recent immigrants, typically of Chinese descent, who have not pass out of ESL classes for three years or more.  The classes are based on the curriculum used in Toastmasters. Students will learn the basics about speech, including eye contact, speaking posture and hand gestures.  Students gain confidence in their English abilities and feel more comfortable conversing with school teachers and their peers.  These skills help them graduate on-time and save class credits in college they might have had to dedicate to ESL.  APEX will also bring professionals to volunteer and help inspire the students.  Last year, MSNBC TV anchor, Richard Lui, volunteered to help teach the class.  \r\n\r\nThe requested funds will be used to support essential staff needed to organize the program, hourly salary for the teachers, and books and supplies for the classes.",
