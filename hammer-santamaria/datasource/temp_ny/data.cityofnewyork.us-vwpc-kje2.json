  "detailed_description" : "As of September 30, 2014, the living wage for some employees in New York City has increased from $11.90 per hour, without benefits, to $13.13. This increase only affects employees who work for commercial tenants at projects that receive more than $1 million in City subsidies. If the tenant provides employees with benefits, then the living wage is set at $11.50 per hour.<br /><br />The living wage increase is an expansion of the City&rsquo;s Fair Wages for New Yorkers Act, through an executive order of the Mayor's office. <div style='position: absolute; left: -40px; top: -25px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;' data-mce-bogus='1' class='mcePaste' id='_mcePaste'></div>",
