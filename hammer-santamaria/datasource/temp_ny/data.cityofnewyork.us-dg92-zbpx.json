DSNY has determined that it is in the best interest of the City to obtain these services from USDA, the recognized experts in wildlife management at airport facilities, including at LaGuardia and JFK airports, to assist DSNY in the implementation of  USDOT/FAA recommendations to ensure the compatibility of the North Shore MTS with safe operations at LaGuardia Airport. Among other things, the USDA wildlife biologist would develop and implement a wildlife hazard management plan for the MTS, monitor and address wildlife activity in the vicinity of the MTS, work with NY area wildlife management working groups and train MTS staff on wildlife management. The estimated amount of the government to government contract is $700,000; the proposed contract term is four years. Qualified vendors that seek to provide such services in connection with a future procurement may contact Bureau Contracting Officer Sarah Dolinar at sdolinar@dsny.nyc.gov",
